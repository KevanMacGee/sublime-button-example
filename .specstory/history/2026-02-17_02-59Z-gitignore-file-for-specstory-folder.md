The user wants me to create a .gitignore file and add the specstory folder to it. This is a simple task - I'll create a .gitignore file with "specstory" (or "specstory/" to be more explicit about ignoring the folder) in it.

I've created the .gitignore file with specstory/ in it. The trailing slash makes it clear we're ignoring the folder (and its contents). This is a standard approach. The task is complete.

Created a `.gitignore` in your project root that ignores the `specstory/` folder. Git will now skip that folder and everything inside it when tracking files.
